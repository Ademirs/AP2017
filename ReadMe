Welcome to AP Computers. Some of the things you should
be aware of before we start, are the following:

1) What operating system are you working with?
   * I prefer linux, and I am using linux
   * You can use anything you like/have, but you
	are responsible for the proper running
	and backup of your computer

2) We will be using git to share code. The git
   repo is 'AP2017'. You can put a directory
   there with your name. For example, there
   is a directory AP2017/MrKrug/

3) Your directory is your place to hand in work
   and share it with me or the class. I suggest
   you set up a directory called 'HandIn', such
   as AP2017/MrKrug/HandIn/ - that is where I 
   will go to find your projects and work. If
   you put every assignment into a separate directory,
   that would also be good... such as 
   AP2017/MrKrug/HandIn/Assign01/HelloWorld.java


4) We will also being doing some collaborative work 
   there.

5) The way I will check your work, is by navigating
   to your assignment directory, and running my
   'runJ' routine. For your edification, you can
   see it in AP2017/MrKrug/binStuff/runJ

6) Assignments must be completed on time. I will
   assign minimum requirements - you are expected
   to do better then the minimum. Through the course,
   we will attempt to determine what 'better' means.
